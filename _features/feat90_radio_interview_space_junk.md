["Could Space Be Earth's Next Landfill?"](https://news.kgnu.org/2021/10/could-space-be-earths-next-landfill/) KGNU reported Alexis Kenyon asks a great question! Alexis interviews myself along with CU graduate student Vishal Ray about the space junk problem and our "Waste in Space" project, developed in collaboration with the [CU Boulder Office of Outreach and Engagement](https://www.colorado.edu/outreach/ooe/art-science-action-partnerships-cohort).
