["Graduate Students Make Art out of Space Debris."](https://www.colorado.edu/spaceweather/2021/11/17/graduate-students-make-art-out-space-debris) Laura Bloom writes an article for the Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center (SWx TREC) about my "Waste in Space" project. The project culminated in an art exhibit displayed at the Arbor Institute at 1708 13th Street in Boulder.
