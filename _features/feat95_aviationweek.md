### Quoted in an Aviation Week Network Article as a 2020 20 Twenties Awardee

["Introducing the 2020 20 Twenties."](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/introducing-2020-20-twenties) In 2020, I was honored to received the AIAA Aviation Week's 20 Twenties Award. This award recognizes Aerospace Engineering students around the world for academic excellence, research innovation, and contributions to education and outreach. The Aviation Week Network article linked above quotes my thoughts on the barriers to STEM education: “One of the biggest problems in the sciences today is that we have a tendency to treat science as inaccessible to certain people. This not only shuts people out from the opportunity for support to pursue science, but also manifests into a culture conditioned to fear science as something that’s untrustworthy or incomprehensible.”

Embedded below is a PDF version of the printed article in the Aviation Week magazine.
