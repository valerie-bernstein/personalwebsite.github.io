Hi, I'm Valerie! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests broadly include satellite drag, space weather, and space situational awareness.

Current Work
======

My graduate work focuses on improving atmospheric drag modeling, which is important for satellite collision avoidance and protecting our technology in space. Specifically, I develop satellite aerodyanmic drag models using information gleaned from orbital data. I analyze multi-satellite orbital drag observations to infer information about the physics of aerodynamic modeling and the variability of Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition,  I strive to use my research and education experiences to promote engagement with and accessibility of Earth and space science, especially for non-technical or younger audiences. Ask me about my space plasma mini-golf design!


Looking ahead
------

I am especially motivated by the following research and applied science challenges:
* Research-to-operations
* Space sustainability and the growing accumulation of space debris
* Technology impacts from the 'next great space weather storm'
* The effect of climate change on Earth's upper atmosphere and implications for space debris
* Data accessibility and visualization

**It's great to virtually meet you!**
