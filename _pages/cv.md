Research Experience
======
* NSF Graduate Research Fellow, University of Colorado Boulder (2017-present)
  * **Thesis: Evaluating Drag Coefficient Modeling Assumptions in Helium-Rich Space Environments**: Updated and developed drag coefficient models using information gleaned from orbital data. Worked on empirical analysis of multi-satellite drag observations to infer information about the physics of drag coefficient modeling and the variability of derived thermospheric densities at high altitudes.
  * **Space Weather Scenario Tool**: Helped to develop a web-based resource for users to map out sequences of complex space weather events. The tool is designed using D3 JavaScript as an interactive tree map and contributes to space weather research-to-operations, visualization, and educational goals.
  * **Deep Space Radiation Genomics (DSRG) Experiment on Artemis 1: Magnetotail and Bow Shock Effect**: Selected experimental time windows for the DSRG experiment based on when the lunar-orbiting Artemis 1 is exposed to the solar wind radiation environment outside the magnetotail.

* Space Weather Summer School Vela Fellow, Los Alamos National Laboratory (2018)
  * **Investigating Helium in TIE-GCM Predictions of Satellite Drag**: Characterized the impact of atmospheric helium on the satellite drag experienced by Low Earth Orbit satellites, including CHAMP and GRACE. Simulated atmospheres with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model using NCAR's Cheyenne supercomputer.

* Student Research Intern, Los Alamos National Laboratory (2017)
  * **Timing Comparisons for GLEs and High-Energy Proton Events using GPS Proton Measurements**: Analyzed a variety of energetic particle datasets to investigate the arrival times of high-energy solar protons at GPS satellites, GOES spacecraft, and ground-based Neutron Monitor stations.

* NSF REU Research Assistant, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (2016)
  * **Origin of Long-Duration Solar Gamma-ray Flares**: Statistically analyzed connections between long-duration gamma-ray flares and solar energetic particles, X-ray flares, coronal mass ejections, and type II radio bursts. Collaborated with scientists from the National Solar Observatory, Atmospheric and Environmental Research, and the Fermi Large Area Telescope group.

* NSF REU Research Assistant, Lehigh University (2015)
  * **Precovery of Eclipsing Binaries**: Analyzed light curves of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler/K2 and the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) to identify timing variations and refine periods.
